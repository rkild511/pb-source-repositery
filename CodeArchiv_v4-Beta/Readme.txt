Dear PureBasic community! 

The PureBasic CodeArchive contain the collected sourcecodes from the
english, german and french PureBasic forums as well the PureBasic-
Lounge and other submissions. 

I've tried to sort the codes into a suitable list structure as well as
possible and to create a overview of the collected codes with the html
surface (please call it via CodeArchiv.html), which is useable online
and offline. Simply use the search function of your browser (CTRL + F).

With "C.A.V. - the CodeArchivViewer" its now possible to do a comfortable
search in the CodeArchiv in offline modus. More about this is written in
the included manual.

My gratitude goes in this place to Oliver Baum, who originally brought
this project to life in the year 2002. Of course many thanks also to all
authors, which provide their codes for the public.

All PureBasic programmers, who recognize their code in this collection
may inform me about it, so that I can complete the corresponding
information.

I'm also very grateful for all "new submissions", as well additions,
remarks, criticism, praise etc.... :)

| Some notes about this version v4 Beta:                           |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
. Most codes are now compatible with PureBasic v4.
. There was included a note in the codes, if they run on the different
  OS supported by PureBasic as well if they run with the PureBasic-Demo.
. With the C.A.V. in version 1.1 its now possible, to do a comfortable
  offline browsing in the CodeArchiv.

 I need help:
 ------------
. with updating the french edition of this readme file
. with translating the manual of C.A.V. in other languages -
  actually german is included as well english in a started version.
. with updating existing or adding new locale files for the individual
  localization of C.A.V.
  German, English and French are native integrated - Dutch, Espanol,
  Italiano and Portuguese are available in an older version.
  The file BaseLanguage.catalog you will find in CodeArchiv\xCAV
. with adding new codes, actually most of the examples codes are from
  the years 2002-2005. There is a lot more potential in the PureBasic
  forums!
  How a code will be correctly prepared for the CodeArchiv (means how 
  the needed data about source, author, etc. must be added), you will
  find in the chapter "Technical" in the CAV manual.
. with converting already collected codes in a PB v4 compatible version,
  a regularly updated list I release here:

  => Contributions please via e-mail to: andre@purearea.net - Many thanks!
